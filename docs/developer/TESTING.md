# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the Emoji Slots Builder application. It covers the different types of testing to be performed, test environments, test cases, and quality assurance procedures to ensure the application meets quality standards.

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify that all features work as specified in the requirements
2. Ensure the application is responsive across different devices and screen sizes
3. Validate that the slot machine engine correctly calculates wins and applies features
4. Confirm that user data is properly saved and retrieved from local storage
5. Ensure the application is accessible and usable for all users
6. Verify performance meets acceptable standards

## Testing Types

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions and components in isolation.

#### Test Framework
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- React Testing Library for component testing

#### Key Areas for Unit Testing

1. **Slot Machine Engine**
   - Symbol generation and randomization
   - Win calculation algorithms
   - Feature application (wilds, scatters, jackpots)
   - RTP validation

2. **Utility Functions**
   - Storage helpers
   - Validation functions
   - Mathematical calculations

3. **React Components**
   - Rendering of UI elements
   - State management within components
   - Event handling

#### Example Unit Tests

```typescript
// Testing the win calculation function
describe('checkWinningLines', () => {
  it('should correctly identify a winning line with matching symbols', () => {
    const grid = [
      ['A', 'B', 'C'],
      ['A', 'A', 'A'],
      ['D', 'E', 'F']
    ];
    const paylines = [
      { id: '1', positions: [3, 4, 5], color: '#ff0000' }
    ];
    const symbols = [
      { id: 'A', emoji: '🍎', name: 'Apple', payouts: [0, 0, 5], isWild: false, isScatter: false, isJackpot: false, weight: 1 }
    ];
    const bet = 1;
    
    const result = checkWinningLines(grid, paylines, symbols, bet);
    
    expect(result).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result[0].paylineId).toBe('1');
    expect(result[0].payout).toBe(5);
  });
  
  it('should apply wild symbols correctly', () => {
    const grid = [
      ['A', 'B', 'C'],
      ['W', 'A', 'A'],
      ['D', 'E', 'F']
    ];
    const paylines = [
      { id: '1', positions: [3, 4, 5], color: '#ff0000' }
    ];
    const symbols = [
      { id: 'A', emoji: '🍎', name: 'Apple', payouts: [0, 0, 5], isWild: false, isScatter: false, isJackpot: false, weight: 1 },
      { id: 'W', emoji: '⭐', name: 'Wild', payouts: [0, 0, 10], isWild: true, isScatter: false, isJackpot: false, weight: 0.5 }
    ];
    const bet = 1;
    
    const result = checkWinningLines(grid, paylines, symbols, bet);
    
    expect(result).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result[0].paylineId).toBe('1');
    expect(result[0].payout).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### Key Areas for Integration Testing

1. **Slot Builder to Storage**
   - Creating a slot machine and saving it
   - Retrieving and editing a saved slot machine

2. **Game Directory to Slot Machine**
   - Selecting a game from the directory and playing it
   - Returning to the directory after playing

3. **Theme Application**
   - Applying a theme and verifying it affects all relevant components

#### Example Integration Tests

```typescript
describe('Slot Builder Integration', () => {
  it('should save a slot configuration to localStorage', async () => {
    // Setup
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    const { getByText, getByLabelText } = render(<SlotBuilder />);
    
    // Fill in slot machine details
    await user.type(getByLabelText('Slot Name'), 'Test Slot');
    await user.type(getByLabelText('Author'), 'Test Author');
    
    // Add symbols, configure paylines, etc.
    // ...
    
    // Save the slot machine
    await user.click(getByText('Save Slot Machine'));
    
    // Verify it was saved to localStorage
    const savedSlots = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('slotMachines') || '[]');
    const savedSlot = savedSlots.find(slot => slot.name === 'Test Slot');
    
    expect(savedSlot).toBeDefined();
    expect(savedSlot.author).toBe('Test Author');
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Testing

E2E tests verify complete user flows from start to finish.

#### Test Framework
- Cypress for browser-based end-to-end testing

#### Key User Flows for E2E Testing

1. **Creating and Playing a Slot Machine**
   - Navigate to the slot builder
   - Create a complete slot machine
   - Save the slot machine
   - Navigate to the game directory
   - Find and play the created slot machine
   - Verify gameplay works correctly

2. **Editing an Existing Slot Machine**
   - Navigate to the game directory
   - Select a slot machine to edit
   - Make changes to the configuration
   - Save the changes
   - Verify the changes are reflected in gameplay

#### Example E2E Test

```javascript
describe('Create and Play Slot Machine', () => {
  it('should allow creating and playing a custom slot machine', () => {
    // Visit the application
    cy.visit('/');
    
    // Navigate to slot builder
    cy.contains('Create New Slot').click();
    
    // Fill in slot details
    cy.get('[data-testid="slot-name-input"]').type('Cypress Test Slot');
    cy.get('[data-testid="author-input"]').type('Cypress');
    
    // Configure symbols, paylines, etc.
    // ...
    
    // Save the slot machine
    cy.contains('Save Slot Machine').click();
    
    // Verify we're redirected to the game directory
    cy.url().should('include', '/directory');
    
    // Find and play our slot machine
    cy.contains('Cypress Test Slot').parent().contains('Play Now').click();
    
    // Verify we can play the game
    cy.get('[data-testid="bet-amount"]').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('[data-testid="spin-button"]').should('be.visible').click();
    
    // Verify spin animation occurs
    cy.get('[data-testid="reel"]').should('have.class', 'spinning');
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests ensure the application runs smoothly under various conditions.

#### Key Performance Metrics
